Plugin for Nokia N9 Harmattan (MeeGo) Share UI for sharing to 
various social and bookmarking sites, including:

  * Diaspora*
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * Google+
  * LinkedIn
  * Tumblr
  * DZone
  * Ping FM
  * Delicious
  * Google Bookmarks
  * Google Translate
  * Digg
  * StumbleUpon

Any of the basic targets can be disabled by editing configuration
file /opt/sharetus/sharetus.json
Look for the "status" value for a target and change it to 0.

Also custom targets can be added, though currently only by editing
the preferences file by hand. These changes will be kept over upgrades.
Example of custom target can be found after install from 
~/.sharetus/preferences.json or on Github preferences_template.json.

TODO:
 - Add image support for Diaspora*
 - Add post excerpt for supported targets
 - Retrieve tags after app load to decrease startup time
 - Add GUI for configuring custom targets
 - Add GUI for setting basic targets on/off

Contributions from elsewhere:
 - Python classes in src/tags.py and src/targets.py, which are 
   based on the example from
   http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/Selectable_list_of_Python_objects_in_QML
 - C++ classes SharetusPlugin and SharetusMethod, which are based
   on CmdShare by Tuomas Kulve

 - Help on retrieving tags from Tracker by various Maemo.org and
